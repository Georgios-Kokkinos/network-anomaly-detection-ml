Network Anomaly Detection - Short Report
        Date: 2026-01-16

        Overview
        Three tree-based classifiers (RandomForest, XGBoost, LightGBM) were trained on a unified CICIDS 2017 pipeline with hybrid class balancing (downsample majority + SMOTE). A single stratified 80/20 hold-out enables fair comparison across models.

        Data Slice
        Total rows after cleaning: 763462. Train: 610769. Test: 152693. Features retained: 78. Classes observed: 12.
